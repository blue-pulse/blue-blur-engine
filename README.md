## Description

Blue Blur Engine is a 2D game engine developed with GameMaker. The main objective is to provide a tool that allows the creation of games in the style of Sonic The Hedgehog, with a focus on 'boost' gameplay. Every aspect of the game is fully customizable, from the characters and levels to the obstacles and special effects.

It's important to note that *Sonic The Hedgehog* and all its content, including characters, music, and sound effects, are owned by SEGA and the Sonic Team.
