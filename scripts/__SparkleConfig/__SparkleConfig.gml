// Group name to initialize to when SparkleStore boots up. This can be overriden later by calling
// `SparkleSetGroupName()`. The group name determines the save directory that a file gets placed

#macro SPARKLE_DEFAULT_GROUP_NAME  "data"

// Group name to initialize to when running from the IDE. Setting this macro to anything other than

// Whether SparkleStore is allowed to use `steam_file_*` functions to save and load data. This
// macro only applies if you have enabled Steam Cloud for your game and the player has enabled
// Steam Cloud for their account. In the event that either has been disabled, SparkleStore will
// save to local storage in the file system sandbox regardless of the value of this macro.
// 
// If you set this macro to `true` then SparkleStore will default to trying to save files to
// Steam's own storage, avoiding saving the file to the sandbox area entirely. You don't need to
// configure anything for Steam Cloud to work beyond the maximum space and file count.
// 
// If you want to use Steam Auto-Cloud system - where files found into a particular directory are
// backed up automatically - then set this macro to `false` and configure Steam Cloud to point to
// the file system sandbox location (given by `game_save_id`).
// 
// If this macro is set to `true`, you can further toggle the use of `steam_file_*` functions by
// using `SparkleSetSteamFile()` which is useful to save particular kinds of files to local storage
// rather than into the cloud (e.g. for local settings files).
#macro SPARKLE_ALLOW_STEAM_FILE  false
