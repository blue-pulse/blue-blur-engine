// Feather disable all

/// Starts an asynchronous load operation for a buffer (or part of a buffer). If the load operation
/// is successful, the contents of the file will be placed into a buffer that SparkleStore creates
/// for you. This buffer is then returned via the callback (see below). You can also specify a
/// priority using one of the `SPARKLE_PRIORITY_*` constants. Please see `__SparkleConstants` for
/// more information.
/// 
/// N.B. For compatibility with `SparkleDelete()` on consoles, very small empty files will be
///      treated as though they don't exist and load operations will return as failed.
/// 
/// N.B. When calling `SparkleLoad*()` you should always handle failed operations in that callback
///      regardless of whatever this `SparkleExist()` returns.
/// 
/// N.B. The filename you provide must be a simple filename and not a path that includes directory
///      changes. If you would like to load from a particular directory within the file system
///      sandbox, please use `SparkleSetGroupName()`. Loading outside the sandbox is not supported.
/// 
/// The callback for this function will be executed with three parameters:
/// 
/// argument0: The "status" of the load operation. This is one of the `SPARKLE_STATUS_*`
///            constants. Please see the `__SparkleConstants` script for more information.
/// 
/// argument1: A buffer that, hopefully, contains data loaded from the file. The buffer can be
///            empty but the status can be `true` in some edge cases on console. Be sure to check
///            if it has content before using it. Regardless, a buffer is always returned and you
///            are responsible for destroying this buffer if you don't need it.
/// 
/// argument2: The callback metadata specified when calling `SparkleLoad()`.
/// 
/// This function returns a struct that contains private information that SparkleStore needs to
/// track file loading. The struct has no public variables. However, it has the following public
/// methods:
/// 
/// `.GetOperation()`
///     Returns `SPARKLE_OP_LOAD`.
/// 
/// `.GetFilename()`
///     Returns the filename that the operation is targeting.
/// 
/// `.GetCallbackMetadata()`
///     Returns the callback metadaata set when calling `SparkleLoad()`.
/// 
/// `.Cancel()`
///     Cancels the operation immediately. This will execute the callback with the
///     `SPARKLE_STATUS_CANCELLED` status.
/// 
/// `.GetStatus()`
///     Returns the status of the operation. This will be one of the `SPARKLE_STATUS_*` constants.
///     Please see `__SparkleConstants` for more information.
/// 
/// @param filename
/// @param callback
/// @param [callbackMetadata]
/// @param [priority=normal]
