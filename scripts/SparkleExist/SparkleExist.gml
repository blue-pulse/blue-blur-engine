// Feather disable all

/// Returns if a file exists, or `undefined` if the state of the file is not yet known.
/// 
/// N.B. This function will often return `undefined` due to the underlying asynchronous operation
///      take time to complete. You must handle this case in your code or you will encounter bugs.
///      Please continue reading for more information.
/// 
/// N.B. When calling `SparkleLoad*()` you should always handle failed operations in that callback
///      regardless of whatever `SparkleExist()` returns.
/// 
/// Returning whether a file exists on desktop is easy because we have a synchronous "instant"
/// native function call in `file_exists()`. Unfortunately, this function is not available across
/// every platform. Instead, we have to use an asynchronous load operation to try to read the file.
/// If the load fails then the file doesn't exist, if it succeeds then it does exist.
/// 
/// Regretably, using an asynchronous operation makes this process rather clumsy. To smooth things
/// out, SparkleStore keeps an internal cache that tracks whether files do or don't exist. When you
/// load a file using `SparkeLoad*()`, the result of that load operation is recorded. Similary, if
/// you successfully save or delete a file, the file's cached state is updated accordingly.
/// 
/// If you call `SparkleExist()` on a file that has not previously been saved or loaded (which is
/// usually the case) then the function will execute a silent load in the background and then cache
/// the result. You can force a load to happen, i.e. refresh the cache, by setting the optional
/// `forceLoad` parameter to `true`. You can return if a file state has been cached by calling
/// `SparkleExistCached()`.
/// 
/// Caches can easily get out of sync with reality so you should occasionally clear the cache to
/// cause SparkleStore to re-check file presence. `SparkleExistClearCache()` is provided to wipe
/// the cache manually. When you should do this is up to you but, as a suggestion, clearing the
/// when returning to the main menu from gameplay or by exiting a settings menu may be appropriate.
/// 
/// N.B. For compatibility with `SparkleDelete()` on consoles, very small empty files will be
///      treated as though they don't exist.
/// 
/// N.B. The filename you provide must be a simple filename and not a path that includes directory
///      changes. If you would like to delete a file from a particular directory within the file
///      system sandbox, please use `SparkleSetGroupName()`. Deleting files outside the sandbox is
///      not supported.
/// 
/// `SparkleExist()` is considered to be a "load" operation internally and this function will
/// increment `SparkleGetLoadPending()` and `SparkleGetLoadRecent()` in particular.
/// 
/// You may optionally specify a callback and callback metadata. The callback, if provided, will
/// always be executed whether or not a value exists in the cache. The callback for this function
/// will be executed with three parameters:
/// 
/// argument0: Whether the file exists, or `undefined` if SparkleStore could not execute the load
///            operation successfully (typically because the another operation to do the same thing
///            already exists).
///            
///            N.B. Your callback must handle this value being `undefined` or you will encounter
///                 crashes and other unexpected behaviour.
/// 
/// argument1: Whether the value for `argument0` is a cached value (`true`) or a value obtained by
///            loading the file (`false`).
/// 
/// argument2: The callback metadata specified when calling `SparkleExist()`.
/// 
/// @param filename
/// @param [callback]
/// @param [callbackMetadata]
/// @param [forceLoad=false]
/// @param [priority=normal]
